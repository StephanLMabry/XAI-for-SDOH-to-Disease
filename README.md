# XAI-for-SDOH-to-Disease
# Explainable AI (XAI) for Diagnosis Prediction Using MEPS SDOH Data

This project explores how Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) from the 2021 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) can be used to predict a set of 23 self-reported diagnoses. The primary goal is not only predictive performance, but interpretability‚Äîassessing which variables drive model decisions using multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

## üìä Data Sources

- **Dataset**: [MEPS 2021 Full-Year Consolidated (HC-233)](https://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-233)  
- **SDOH Definitions**: [Healthy People 2030 ‚Äì ODPHP](https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health)

## üöß Known Limitations

- MEPS is a self-reported survey dataset, with no clinical depth or longitudinal tracking
- Only non-clinical SDOH variables were used for modeling
- Some XAI methods (e.g., permutation importance) identified spurious features such as survey month
- Attribution ‚â† causation‚Äîinterpretations should be treated cautiously

---

## üîÆ Future Work

- **Integrate Clinical Data**: Add diagnoses, labs, and treatment history from EHRs
- **Clinician Validation**: Align explanations with clinical reasoning and workflows
- **Causal Inference**: Apply DAGs, causal SHAP, or twin networks for causal discovery
- **Next-Gen Explainability**: Build contrastive, counterfactual, or interactive explanation tools
