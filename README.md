# XAI-for-SDOH-to-Disease
Explainable AI (XAI) for Diagnosis Prediction Using MEPS SDOH Data
This project uses Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) data from the 2021 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to predict the presence of 23 self-reported diagnoses. The focus is not only on model performance but also on the interpretability of predictions using multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

üîß Files Included

File	Description
MEPSAnalysis.py	Main script for data processing, model training, and XAI computation
model_results.csv	Summary of model performance (F1, accuracy, precision, recall) across all diagnoses
xai_summary_normalized.csv	Normalized XAI scores across models and techniques
Column_Specs_and_Names_trimmed.csv	Cleaned variable name mappings for MEPS SDOH columns
üß† Project Highlights
23 binary classification models, one for each diagnosis

4 model types: XGBoost, Neural Network, Decision Tree, Ensemble

6 XAI methods:

SHAP

LIME

Integrated Gradients

Saliency Maps

Permutation Importance

Feature Ablation

Normalized attribution scores allow direct comparison across methods

Analysis focuses on alignment, consistency, and outliers in explanation outputs

üìä Data Source
Dataset: MEPS 2021 Full-Year Consolidated (HC-233)

SDOH Definitions: Healthy People 2030 ‚Äì ODPHP

üöß Limitations
MEPS is a self-reported survey, lacking clinical detail or longitudinal depth

Only SDOH variables used‚Äîno lab values or diagnoses during modeling

Attribution ‚â† causation: some results may reflect statistical artifacts (e.g., survey month)

üîÆ Future Directions
Add EHR-based clinical variables for validation

Incorporate clinician review for interpretation vetting

Explore causal inference with SHAP-DAGs or counterfactuals

Expand beyond feature attribution to interactive explanation tools
